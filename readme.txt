Kvasir-Sessile dataset (Sessile polyps from Kvasir-SEG)
Introduced by Jha et al. in Kvasir-SEG: A Segmented Polyp Dataset
The Kvasir-SEG dataset includes 196 polyps smaller than 10 mm classified as Paris class 1 sessile or Paris class IIa. 
We have selected it with the help of expert gastroenterologists. We have released this dataset separately as a subset 
of Kvasir-SEG. We call this subset Kvasir-Sessile.

The dataset is publicly available. It can be downloaded from here:
